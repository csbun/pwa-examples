  <h2>Cache all files on install</h2>
  <p>If all the files are successfully cached, then the service worker will be installed. If any of the files fail to download, then the install step will fail. This allows you to rely on having all the assets that you defined.</p>
  <h2>Cache and return requests</h2>
  <p>
    Fetch '/service-workers-cache/css/style.css', '/service-workers-cache/js/index.js' from CACHE and '/service-workers-cache/css/color.css' from REMOTE.
  </p>

  <p>By default, fetching a resource from a third party URL will fail if it doesn't support CORS. You can add a no-CORS option to the Request to overcome this, although this will cause an 'opaque' response, which means you won't be able to tell if the response was successful or not.</p>
